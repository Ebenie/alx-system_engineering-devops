•	The "www" in www.foobar.com is typically a CNAME (Canonical Name) DNS record that points to the domain's primary A record.
4.	What is the role of the web server?
•	The web server is responsible for handling and responding to HTTP requests from clients (such as web browsers) by serving web pages or other content.
5.	What is the role of the application server?
•	The application server hosts and executes the codebase of an application, handling tasks such as processing user requests, generating dynamic content, and interacting with databases.
6.	What is the role of the database?

8.	What are the issues with this infrastructure?
•	SPOF: Single Point of Failure where if the server fails, the entire website becomes inaccessible.
•	Downtime during maintenance: Deploying new code or performing maintenance tasks may require restarting the web server, leading to temporary downtime.
•	Scalability limitations: Inability to handle high volumes of incoming traffic due to the constraints of a single server setup.
