1.	Why Adding Three Firewalls?
•	Adding three firewalls increases security by implementing multiple layers of protection to filter and control incoming and outgoing traffic.
2.	Why Adding an SSL Certificate?
•	Adding an SSL certificate encrypts traffic between the server and the user's browser, ensuring data privacy and security.
3.	Why Adding Monitoring Clients?
•	Adding monitoring clients enables proactive monitoring of the infrastructure's health, performance, and availability, allowing for timely detection and resolution of issues.
4.	Firewalls Purpose:
•	Firewalls are used to control and monitor incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules, protecting the network from unauthorized access and potential security threats.
5.	HTTPS Traffic:
•	Traffic is served over HTTPS to encrypt data transmitted between the server and the client, safeguarding sensitive information from interception and unauthorized access.
6.	Monitoring Purpose:
•	Monitoring is used to track the performance, availability, and health of the infrastructure components in real-time, allowing for proactive troubleshooting and optimization.
7.	Monitoring Data Collection:
•	Monitoring tools collect data by deploying monitoring agents or clients on each server, which gather metrics, logs, and other relevant information and send it to a centralized monitoring system or service for analysis.
8.	Monitoring Web Server QPS:
•	To monitor web server QPS (queries per second), you can configure monitoring tools to track and analyze incoming requests and responses, identifying patterns and trends in web traffic.
9.	Issues with this Infrastructure:
•	Terminating SSL at the load balancer level can be an issue as it adds an extra step in the communication process, potentially slowing down performance and increasing latency.
•	Having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes creates a single point of failure, risking data loss or downtime if the server fails.
•	Having servers with all the same components might be a problem as it lacks redundancy and diversity, increasing the risk of a single point of failure across the entire infrastructure.
