Introduction:
As a Full-Stack Software Engineer, understanding the inner workings of the web stack is essential. In this blog post, we'll explore the journey of a simple web request - typing https://www.google.com into the browser and pressing Enter. We'll dive into various components of the web stack, from DNS resolution to database interaction, to gain a comprehensive understanding of how the internet functions.

DNS Request:
The journey begins with a Domain Name System (DNS) request. When you type https://www.google.com into your browser, the browser sends a DNS query to a DNS resolver to translate the human-readable domain name "www.google.com" into an IP address. This process involves multiple steps, including querying root servers, authoritative DNS servers, and caching mechanisms, ultimately returning the IP address of the Google server.

TCP/IP:
Once the browser has obtained the IP address of the server, it establishes a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection using the Internet Protocol (IP). TCP/IP is the fundamental protocol suite of the internet, responsible for reliable data transmission between devices. Through a series of handshake packets, the browser and the server establish a connection, enabling the exchange of data.

Firewall:
Before the data reaches the server, it may pass through a firewall, a security device that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic. The firewall examines each packet to determine whether to allow or block it based on predefined security rules. It protects the server from unauthorized access and malicious attacks.

HTTPS/SSL:
In the case of https://www.google.com, the connection between the browser and the server is secured using HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) with SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or its successor, TLS (Transport Layer Security). This encryption protocol ensures that the data transmitted between the client and the server is encrypted and protected from eavesdropping and tampering.

Load-Balancer:
Google's infrastructure likely employs load balancers to distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers to ensure high availability and scalability. Load balancers monitor server health and traffic patterns, intelligently routing requests to the most suitable server based on factors such as server load, geographic location, and latency.

Web Server:
Once the request reaches the appropriate server, such as one of Google's many web servers, the server processes the request and generates a response. A web server is responsible for handling HTTP requests, serving web pages, and executing server-side scripts.

Application Server:
In complex web applications, an application server may come into play to handle dynamic content generation and business logic processing. Application servers execute code written in languages like Python, Java, or Node.js, interacting with databases, caching systems, and other backend services.

Database:
In the case of Google, a vast amount of data is stored in databases to support services like search, email, and maps. Databases store structured data and provide mechanisms for querying, updating, and managing data efficiently. Google likely utilizes distributed, highly available databases to handle the scale of its operations.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, the journey of a web request from typing https://www.google.com into the browser to receiving search results involves a complex interplay of various components of the web stack. From DNS resolution to database interaction, each step contributes to delivering a seamless and secure browsing experience for users worldwide.
